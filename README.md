This code requires: python 2.7: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/ ipython: http://ipython.org/install.html ipython Notebook: http://ipython.org/notebook.html

Basically what comes with Continuum's python tool Anaconda: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ OR! more specifically here: matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/ pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/ numpy: http://www.numpy.org/

You also need NetCDF4, which itself takes a couple libraries. Instructions to install are here http://fastml.com/predicting-solar-energy-from-weather-forecasts-plus-a-netcdf4-tutorial/

Honestly, if you want to run the code, come talk to us.
